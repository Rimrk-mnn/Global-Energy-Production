# Global-Energy-Production

This project grew out of my interest in the development of global energy production and, in the process of analyzing the data, threw up other interesting aspects, such as further exploring the connection with rising global consumption and (growing) shares of renewable energy against the production where non-renewables are involved. 

## following datasets were used for analysis:
dataset produce: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ccanb23/iea-monthly-electricity-statistics
dataset consumption: https://ourworldindata.org/energy#explore-data-on-energy
